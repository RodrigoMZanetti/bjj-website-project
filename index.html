        <p>Whether you're just starting out or have been training for years, these simple tips can help you improve on and off the mat. Jiu-jitsu is more than technique, it’s about building good habits, staying healthy, and keeping the right mindset.</p>

        <h2>Rest</h2>
        <p>Rest is as important as training itself. Your body needs time to recover from intense sessions on the mat. Taking at least one or two days off per week helps prevent injuries, reduces muscle fatigue, and allows your technique to sink in.</p>

        <h2>Proper Diet</h2>
        <p>A balanced diet fuels your performance. Focus on lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables to maintain energy and support muscle repair. Avoid heavy or processed foods before training, as they can slow you down.</p>

        <h2>Sleep</h2>
        <p>Sleep is the foundation of recovery. Aim for 7 to 9 hours of quality sleep each night to give your body the time it needs to heal and your mind the rest it deserves. Good sleep also improves focus and reaction time during sparring.</p>

        <h2>Consistency</h2>
        <p>Progress in jiu-jitsu doesn’t come overnight. Show up consistently, even when you feel tired or unmotivated. Small improvements over time build strong habits and make a big difference in your performance.</p>

        <h2>Mindset</h2>
        <p>A positive mindset is key. Accept that mistakes are part of learning and see challenges as opportunities to grow. Respect your training partners and focus on technique rather than brute strength.</p>
